      This yeasted dough is so soft and easy to work with. I don't really like
      kneading by hand, so I used a bread machine instead for the kneading part
      only. You can stuff it with whatever fillings you like or leave it
      unstuffed. Great for snacking or a side dish.

        <ul>
           <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter-flavored shortening</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 ⅓ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon yeast</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <strong>Filling:</strong>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <strong>Directions:</strong>
            <li>Place lukewarm water, shortening, salt, sugar, bread flour, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine at the kneading, 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 5 pieces and roll them into balls. Place on a floured surface, cover with a slightly damp cloth, and leave to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt oil and butter for filling in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until onions soften, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and garlic and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Roll dough circles into flat rounds, 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Fill one half each circle with spinach mixture, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, then fold the other half over and seal the edges.</li>
            <li>Preheat a griddle or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Brush one side of each gozleme with oil and place on the hot pan; cook until base is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush top side with olive oil, turn, and cook until golden, another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
